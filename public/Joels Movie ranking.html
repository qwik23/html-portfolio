<h2>Action Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Transporter</h3>
<p>I mean Jason Stratham driving fast BMs and Audis, shooting people and eventially saving the day - who doesnt love that?!?!</p>
<h3>Seal Team 6</h3>
<p>The Brotherhood! Just that way they follow each other anywhere, and protect each another, it is insiringg stuff!</p>
<h3>Transformers 1</h3>
<p>Just the way they brought this movie to life is increadable. As a car guy, i would have loved for my car to change into a robot and save the world. Just too cool!</p>
